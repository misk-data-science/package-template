# R & Python Packaging Template

This is a customized command line tool that is used in conjunction with the [Delivering Data Science Products via Packages](https://github.com/misk-data-science/misk-packages) course to help students learn how to build R & Python packages. See the [course notebooks](https://github.com/misk-data-science/misk-packages/blob/master/README.md#schedule) to learn how to use this tool and build upon it to customize your package.
